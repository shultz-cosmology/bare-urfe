# NOVEL_PREDICTIONS: The Running of σ8(z)

## 1. The Dimensional Decoupling Curve
Bare-URFE predicts that the $S_8$ tension is not a static discrepancy but a measurement of **Dimensional Decay**. As the universe evolves and structure collapses, the coupling of the 4th recursive dimension (the Bulk) weakens, leading to a predictable "running" of the clustering amplitude toward a 3D holographic floor.

### The Mechanism of d_eff = 3.25 at High-z
At the epoch of Recombination (CMB), the vacuum information is in a state of maximal symmetry. In a 4D Torus ($T^4$), the **Equipartition of Entropy** dictates that each dimension contributes an equal unit fraction to the coupling.
* **Derivation**: $d_{eff} = 3 \text{ (Observed Space)} + (1/4) \text{ (Bulk Coupling)} = 3.25$.
* **Primary σ8**: $\sigma_{8,CMB} = 3.25 / 4 = 0.8125$.

### The Shultz Floor at Low-z
As the universe expands and the recursive map reaches its fixed point, the 4th dimension fully decouples from the matter clustering power, leaving only the 3-manifold capacity.
* **Derivation**: $d_{eff} = 3.0$.
* **Final σ8**: $\sigma_{8,Local} = 3.0 / 4 = 0.75$.



## 2. Predicted Evolutionary Track
The transition from 0.8125 to 0.75 is not instantaneous. It follows a **Logarithmic Decay** corresponding to the growth of cosmic structure ($z \approx 1100 \to 0$):
* **z > 1000**: Platform at 0.8125.
* **z ≈ 10 to 2**: Onset of measurable decay as dimensional leakage into the vacuum background accelerates.
* **z < 1**: Convergence to the 0.75 floor.

## 3. Falsifiability (The October 2026 Window)
This prediction is explicitly binary. Data from **Euclid DR1 (October 21, 2026)** and **DESI** will provide high-precision measurements of $\sigma_8$ at intermediate redshifts ($z \approx 0.5$ to $2.0$).

1. **Confirmation**: If the data shows $\sigma_8$ trending from $\approx 0.81$ toward $0.75$ at late times, the 4D topological projection is confirmed.
2. **Falsification**: If $\sigma_8$ remains constant at $\approx 0.81$ (supporting standard $\Lambda$CDM growth) or falls below $0.75$, the Bare-URFE model is falsified.
