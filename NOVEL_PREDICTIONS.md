# NOVEL_PREDICTIONS: The Running of σ8(z) and the 0.78 Attractor

## 1. The Dynamic Decay Equation
Bare-URFE identifies the $S_8$ tension as a **Dimensional Decoupling Curve**. As the universe evolves, the additional spectral weight from the 4th-dimensional bulk leaks into the vacuum, but matter remains "suspended" slightly above the geometric floor due to recursive winding energy (the 1:8:64 hierarchy).

The updated evolutionary track is governed by the following identity:

$$\sigma_8(z) = \text{Attractor} + (\sigma_{8,CMB} - \text{Attractor}) \cdot \left(\frac{\ln(1+z)}{\ln(1101)}\right)^\gamma$$

* **z = 1100 (CMB Epoch):** $\sigma_8 \approx 0.8125$ (The 3.25/4 Coupling).
* **z = 0 (Local Universe):** $\sigma_8 \rightarrow \mathbf{0.7814}$ (The Toroidal Matter Attractor).
* **The Floor:** $\sigma_8 = \mathbf{0.7500}$ (The absolute Geometric Limit).

**Note:** While the "Floor" is 0.75, the "Observation" is predicted to be ~0.78 due to the $0.42$ rotational coupling constant derived in `TOROIDAL_S8_ATTRACTOR.py`.

## 2. The Euclid DR1 Benchmark (Oct 21, 2026)
This model provides a binary, falsifiable test for the upcoming Euclid Data Release 1. We predict a specific "attractor corridor" that sits between $\Lambda$CDM and the 0.75 Floor.

* **SUCCESS:** Late-time spectroscopic and lensing probes ($z < 1$) show a preference for **$\sigma_8 \approx 0.78 \pm 0.01$**. This confirms the value is "falling" toward the floor but is held stable by the 4D toroidal winding.
* **FAILURE:** High-precision data confirms $\sigma_8$ remains constant at $\approx 0.81$, or falls all the way to $0.75$ without the predicted $0.78$ "hover" effect.

## 3. Physical Mechanism: The "Hover" Effect
The 25% spectral weight lost during the 4D-to-3D transition creates the 0.75 floor. However, because the Cosmic Web is a dynamical system, the "Matter Filaments" retain winding energy. 



This "missing" variance (the 0.03 gap between the floor and the attractor) is the geometric origin of the **Cosmological Constant ($\Lambda$)**. The $S_8$ tension and the Hubble tension are thus two perspectives of the same **Topological Phase Transition**.
