# NOVEL_PREDICTIONS: The Running of σ8(z)

## 1. The Dynamic Decay Equation
Bare-URFE identifies the $S_8$ tension not as a systematic error, but as a **Dimensional Decoupling Curve**. As the universe evolves from the high-energy CMB state to the local era, the additional spectral weight from the 4th-dimensional bulk leaks into the vacuum background. 

The precise evolutionary track is governed by the following identity:

$$\sigma_8(z) = 0.75 + 0.0625 \cdot \left(\frac{\ln(1+z)}{\ln(1101)}\right)^\gamma$$

* **z = 1100 (CMB Epoch)**: $\sigma_8 = 0.8125$ (The $3.25/4$ Coupling).
* **z = 0 (Local Universe)**: $\sigma_8 = 0.7500$ (The Shultz Floor).
* **$\gamma$**: The decay shape parameter, predicted to be constrained by 2026/2027 survey data.



## 2. The Euclid DR1 Benchmark (Oct 21, 2026)
This model provides a binary, falsifiable test for the upcoming **Euclid Data Release 1 (DR1)**. While standard $\Lambda$CDM assumes structure growth on a fixed 3D baseline, Bare-URFE predicts a fundamental "downward tick" in the intrinsic clustering amplitude at late times.

* **Success**: Late-time spectroscopic and lensing probes ($z < 1$) show a statistically significant preference for $\sigma_8 \approx 0.75$ compared to the CMB-extrapolated $\approx 0.81$.
* **Failure**: High-precision data confirms $\sigma_8$ remains constant at the CMB-predicted levels across all measured redshifts.

## 3. Physical Mechanism: Dimensional Leakage
The 25% spectral weight lost during the transition from the 4D source to the 3D sink is redistributed into the vacuum background. This "missing" variance is the geometric origin of the **Cosmological Constant ($\Lambda$)**. Consequently, the $S_8$ tension and the Hubble tension are derived as two perspectives of the same **Topological Phase Transition**.
