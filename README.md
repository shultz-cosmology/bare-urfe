**Status:** Audit Verified (Fixed-Point Convergence)  
**Latest Milestone:** Resolution of Mapping Gap & Euclid-Falsifiable Track

## 🛰️ THE OCTOBER 2026 COUNTDOWN
The most critical prediction of Bare-URFE is the **Running of $\sigma_8$ with Redshift**. Unlike $\Lambda$CDM, which assumes a constant clustering baseline, this framework predicts a fundamental decay toward the 0.75 floor at late times ($z < 1$).

**Benchmark Date: October 21, 2026 (Euclid DR1 Release)**

### The Evolution Equation:
$$\sigma_8(z) = 0.75 + 0.0625 \cdot \left(\frac{\ln(1+z)}{\ln(1101)}\right)^\gamma$$

## 🔬 Scientific Abstract
Bare-URFE (Unified Recursive Field Equations) is a dynamical system framework that derives cosmological constants from recursive fixed points. By treating the vacuum as a complex matrix field subject to iterative refinement, the model provides a deterministic resolution to the **S8 Tension** and the **Vacuum Catastrophe**.

The system identifies a global attractor at $\lambda^* = 0.75$. This is a **Trace-Class Invariant** required by the projection of a 4D complex matrix state into a 3D observable volume. This results in a predicted matter density $\Omega_m = (0.75)^4 = 0.3164$, aligning precisely with Planck 2018 datasets.
