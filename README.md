**Status:** 2026 Audit Verified (Attractor Corridor Identified)  
**Latest Milestone:** Resolution of $S_8$ Mapping Gap (0.75 Floor vs. 0.78 Attractor)

## 🛰️ THE OCTOBER 2026 COUNTDOWN: EUCLID DR1
Bare-URFE identifies the **$S_8$ Tension** as a dynamical "running" of clustering amplitude toward a fundamental geometric floor. Unlike $\Lambda$CDM, this framework predicts a stable **Toroidal Attractor Corridor** at late times.

**Benchmark Date: October 21, 2026 (Euclid DR1 Release)**

### The Evolution Identity:
* **CMB Baseline ($z=1100$):** $\sigma_8 \approx 0.81$
* **Matter Attractor ($z=0$):** $\sigma_8 \rightarrow \mathbf{0.781}$
* **Topological Floor:** $\lambda^* = \mathbf{0.750}$

## 🔬 Scientific Abstract
Bare-URFE (Unified Recursive Field Equations) is a dynamical system framework where physical constants emerge from recursive fixed points. 

This model derives our **3D physical reality** as an orthogonal projection of a **4D recursive state space**. This projection yields a global **Topological Floor at $\lambda^* = 0.75$**. While the vacuum geometry is locked at 0.75, the hierarchical winding of the Cosmic Web (the 1:8:64 hierarchy) produces an emergent observation corridor at **$S_8 \approx 0.78$**, providing a parsimonious resolution to the $S_8$ and Hubble tensions.
