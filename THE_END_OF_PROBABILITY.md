**Abstract**  
Quantum mechanics is not the fundamental layer of reality. It is the effective 3D projection of a deterministic 4D toroidal recursive manifold. All apparent randomness, wavefunction collapse, uncertainty, superposition, and "observer-dependent choice" are illusions created by the rank-3 projection across the Planck phase boundary. The underlying reality is fully pre-determined by global fixed-point attractors anchored at the 0.75 topological floor.

### 1. The Core Axiom: The 0.75 Trace Invariant

The vacuum is a 4D toroidal manifold undergoing unitary recursion. The rank-3 projection that produces our observable 3D space retains exactly 3/4 of the total spectral weight:

$$
\text{Tr}(\hat{H}_{3D}) = \frac{3}{4} \text{Tr}(\hat{H}_{4D}) \quad \Rightarrow \quad \lambda^* = 0.75
$$

This is forced by trace invariance under the SO(2)⁴ ⋊ S₄ isometry group of the torus. The "missing" 0.25 is the traced-out bulk/history coordinate (w). The 0.75 ratio is the **global geometric anchor** of the entire system.

### 2. The Planck Scale as Reflective Phase Boundary

The Planck length is not a hard cutoff. It is a **self-dual phase boundary** where the recursion inverts:

$$
x \mapsto \frac{1}{x}
$$

At this boundary, the 3D shadow reflects into the 4D source via spinor duality. The sine-map recursion folds infinite windings back into the compact toroidal direction. Sub-Planck "distances" in 3D are super-horizon distances in the complementary 4D bulk. No UV divergence occurs — the system remains finite and deterministic on both sides of the mirror.

### 3. The 1:8:64 Toroidal Hierarchy and Emergent Corridor

The pure topological floor is λ* = 0.75.  
The 1:8:64 tesseract winding hierarchy + void repulsion creates an **emergent observable attractor** at:

$$
S_8 \approx 0.75 + \frac{1 - 0.75}{8} = 0.78125
$$

This is exactly what TOROIDAL_S8_ATTRACTOR.py derives without fitting. Current data (DES Y6 0.789 ± 0.012) sits inside this corridor. The universe is running from the CMB baseline (~0.81) through the 0.781 attractor toward the ultimate 0.75 floor.

### 4. Quantum Mechanics as 3D Shadow of Deterministic 4D Recursion

- **Wavefunction collapse** is the 3D observer’s limited view when the deterministic recursion crosses the phase boundary.
- **Superposition** is the projection of multiple pre-determined paths in the 4D bulk onto the 3D shadow.
- **Uncertainty principle** arises because we only see the retained 0.75 fraction — the missing 0.25 bulk contains the pre-determined information.
- **Probabilistic outcomes** and "free will" are illusions created by the incomplete projection. All paths are pre-determined by the global attractor landscape of the 4D recursion.

The entire quantum formalism (including the Born rule and measurement problem) is the effective theory in the 3D shadow. The underlying reality is a single, deterministic 4D recursive engine with fixed-point attractors.

### 5. Mathematical Derivation: Pre-Determination from the Trace Invariant

Let the full 4D state be described by the unitary operator Û on the torus. The Hamiltonian is Ĥ = ln(Û) with trace invariant:

$$
\text{Tr}(\hat{H}_{4D}) = 4T
$$

After rank-3 projection:

$$
\text{Tr}(\hat{H}_{3D}) = 3T \quad \Rightarrow \quad r = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75
$$

The missing sector (0.25) is the bulk coordinate. At the Planck boundary, the map becomes self-dual:

$$
r = 0.75 \quad \leftrightarrow \quad 1 - r = 0.25 \quad \leftrightarrow \quad r = \frac{1}{1 + r} \approx 0.8
$$

The 1:8:64 hierarchy distributes the 0.25 bulk as successive octaves:

$$
\text{First harmonic leakage} = \frac{0.25}{8} = 0.03125
$$

$$
\text{Observable attractor} = 0.75 + 0.03125 = 0.78125
$$

All "quantum choices" are pre-determined paths in the 4D bulk that appear probabilistic only when projected into 3D.

### 7. Final Verdict: The Age of Probability Is Over

The universe is not probabilistic. It is a single, deterministic 4D toroidal recursive engine. Quantum mechanics is the incomplete 3D shadow we observe because we are trapped on one side of the phase boundary. All "choices," collapses, and uncertainties are pre-determined by the global recursion. The 0.75 floor is the fixed geometric anchor that makes the entire system consistent across scales.

Euclid DR1 (October 21, 2026) is the first decisive test. If σ₈ continues running toward the 0.781 corridor and eventually the 0.75 floor, the age of probability ends.

Reality is recursive.  
Reality is pre-determined.
