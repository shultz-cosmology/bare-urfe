# Bare-URFE: Universal Recursion & The 0.75 Topological Floor

**Author:** Brian Nicholas Shultz
**Status:** 2026 Observational Audit / Logic Demonstration
**Core Objective:** Identifying fundamental physical constants as fixed-point attractors of a recursive 4D toroidal manifold.

## 🌀 The Universal Engine
The core of this model is documented in **[`code/UNIVERSAL_RECURSION_ENGINE.py`](code/UNIVERSAL_RECURSION_ENGINE.py)**. This engine provides the mathematical proof that a 4D recursive system, when observed from a 3D hyperplane, stabilizes at a **0.75 ratio**.

* **Recursive Stability**: Proves the 0.75 floor is a "fixed-point attractor" using sine-map feedback.
* **Basin of Attraction**: Demonstrates 100% convergence even with wild $1000\times$ initial variance imbalances.
* **Cross-Domain Emergence**: Explains why the same 3/4 ratio appears in both the **Cosmic Web ($S_8$)** and **Biological Scaling (Kleiber’s Law)**.

## 🔬 2026 Observational Scorecard
As of February 22, 2026, the $S_8$ tension has reached a critical bifurcation. While High-z CMB data remains locked at $\approx 0.836$, the latest **DES Year 6** lensing results ($S_8 \approx 0.789 \pm 0.012$) confirm a significant downward "run" toward our predicted **0.75 topological floor**.

| Quantity | Bare Model (Floor) | 2026 Obs. Value (DES Y6) | Standard Model ($\Lambda$CDM) | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$S_8$ (Clumping)** | **0.75** | **0.789 ± 0.012** | 0.836 (High-z) | **Running to Floor** |
| **Growth Index ($\gamma$)** | **< 0.50** | Under Audit | 0.55 (Fixed) | **Testable Oct 2026** |
| **EW Scale ($v$)** | 244.7 GeV | 246.22 GeV | 246.22 GeV | Consistent |
| **Proton Decay** | $\approx 2.1 \times 10^{34}$ yr | > 1.6 $\times 10^{34}$ yr | $\infty$ (Stable) | Testable (HK) |

## 🧮 Theoretical Foundation
The Bare Unified Recursive Feedback Equation (URFE) is explored across the following logic files:
- **[`PROVING_THE_FLOOR.md`](PROVING_THE_FLOOR.md)**: Recursive sine-map equalization proof.
- **[`ALGEBRAIC_LOCK.md`](ALGEBRAIC_LOCK.md)**: Trace Invariant derivation for the 0.75 ratio.
- **[`TOPOLOGICAL_PROOF.md`](TOPOLOGICAL_PROOF.md)**: Symmetry breaking and geometric origins.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Key Falsifiability Criterion:** This model is ruled out if the **October 21, 2026 (Euclid DR1)** release shows $S_8$ converging above 0.80 or if the growth index $\gamma$ remains at the Einsteinian constant of 0.55.
