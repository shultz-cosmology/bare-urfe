# 🌀 Bare-URFE: Computational Command Center
**Directory:** `/code`  
**Purpose:** Automated Verification of the 0.75 Topological Floor & Cosmic Web Attractors

This directory contains the minimalist, auditor-proof suite used to verify the Bare Unified Recursive Feedback Equation (URFE) and its emergent large-scale structures.

## 🔬 2026 Observational Scorecard (Selection Context)
The logic here is driven by the observed decay of $S_8$ toward the 0.75 floor. The gap between the **Base Model** and the **Observed Value** represents the dynamical tension resolved by the `TOROIDAL_S8_ATTRACTOR` script.

| Quantity | Bare Model (Floor) | 2026 Obs. Value (DES Y6) | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$S_8$ (Clumping)** | **0.75** | **0.789 ± 0.012** | **Running to Floor** |
| **Growth Index ($\gamma$)** | **< 0.50** | Under Audit | **Testable Oct 2026** |

## ⚖️ Dimensional Selection Logic
The universe is not 4D by accident. The scripts in this directory prove that $N=4$ is the unique solution satisfying the **Stability**, **Directional**, and **Topological** layers of reality.



> **Audit Note:** $N=5$ (0.80) is mathematically stable but physically falsified; current observations (0.789) have already breached the 0.80 floor, necessitating the $N=4$ attractor.

## 💻 Execution Suite
Run these scripts to reproduce the attractor and selection results locally.

* [**Universal Recursion Engine**](UNIVERSAL_RECURSION_ENGINE.py): The primary feedback proof showing 0.75 as a fixed-point attractor.
* [**Goldilocks Selection Audit**](goldilocks_audit.py): The 2026 audit script proving $N=4$ stability and rejecting $N=5$ based on observational data.
* [**Toroidal S8 Attractor (Cosmic Web)**](TOROIDAL_S8_ATTRACTOR.py): The honest, non-forced derivation of the 0.78 attractor corridor and the 1:8:64 cosmic web hierarchy.
* [**Sub-Planck Mirror Audit**](bare_urfe_sub_planck_mirror.py): **NEW.** Verifies the reflective phase boundary at the Planck scale. Proves that sub-Planck "drift" (0.58–0.65) is a stable projection of the 4D source view, preventing UV divergence and anchoring the 0.75 trace invariant.

## 🧮 Theoretical Anchors (Main Directory)
These documents provide the algebraic and topological derivations found in the root folder:
- [**Sub-Planck Mirror**](../SUB_PLANCK_MIRROR.md): **NEW.** Explains the $x \mapsto 1/x$ self-duality and why $l_P$ is a reflection point rather than a singularity.
- [**Proving the Floor**](../PROVING_THE_FLOOR.md): The geometric derivation of the 0.75 limit.
- [**Algebraic Lock**](../ALGEBRAIC_LOCK.md): The recursive proof of mode stability.
- [**Topological Proof**](../TOPOLOGICAL_PROOF.md): The 4D Tesseract projection logic.
