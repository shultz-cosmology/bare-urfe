# Shultz Bare-URFE v5.0: The Spectral Trace Lock

> **The 0.75 Invariant**: A derived Trace-Class identity ($4 \times 0.75 = 3$) forced by the $S_4$ isometry group of a 4D Torus vacuum.

## 🛡️ Independent Audit & Verification (PRIORITY)
- [TOPOLOGICAL_PROOF.md](/TOPOLOGICAL_PROOF.md): **The Symmetry-Based Derivation**. Provides the formal group-theoretic proof of spectral isotropy. Primary logical anchor for the 0.75 floor.
- [VERIFICATION.md](/VERIFICATION.md): **Technical Audit Report (2026-02-22)**. Cross-model consensus verifying the internal consistency of the Vacuum Invariance Postulate.

## ⚖️ Algebraic Foundation
- [ALGEBRAIC_LOCK.md](/ALGEBRAIC_LOCK.md): **Trace-Class Invariant Proof**. Formalizes the 0.75 ratio as a result of Rank-3 projection from a symmetric 4D state.

## 🛰️ Testable Predictions (The 2026 Benchmark)
- [NOVEL_PREDICTIONS.md](/NOVEL_PREDICTIONS.md): **The Euclid DR1 Falsification Track**. Defines the specific $\sigma_8(z)$ decay curve expected in the October 21, 2026 data release.

## 📄 Theoretical Framework (The 7-Paper Shield)
- [GEOMETRY_OF_THE_WAVE.md](/GEOMETRY_OF_THE_WAVE.md): **Visualizing the Fold**. Mechanics of 4D-to-3D projection and the origin of Dark Matter.
- [PROVING_THE_FLOOR.md](/PROVING_THE_FLOOR.md): Statistical alignment with 2026 survey datasets.
