# Shultz Bare-URFE v5.1: The Spectral Trace Lock

> **The 0.75 Invariant**: A derived Trace-Class identity ($4 \times 0.75 = 3$) forced by the projection of a 4D vacuum onto 3D space. 
> **The 0.78 Attractor**: The emergent physical clustering value ($S_8$) for late-time matter, representing the "Hover Effect" above the geometric floor.

## 🛡️ Independent Audit & Verification (PRIORITY)
- [VERIFICATION.md](/VERIFICATION.md): **Technical Audit Report (2026-02-15)**. Formal verification by II-Agent that the `bare_urfe.py` engine correctly converges to the **0.75 Floor**.
- [TOPOLOGICAL_PROOF.md](/TOPOLOGICAL_PROOF.md): **The Symmetry-Based Derivation**. Provides the group-theoretic foundation for why the floor is exactly 0.75.

## ⚖️ Logical Filters & Selection
- [GOLDILOCKS_AUDIT](/code/goldilocks_audit.py): **Dimensional Selection Proof**. Proves that $N=4$ is the only stable dimensionality for the URFE recursive matrix.
- [ALGEBRAIC_LOCK.md](/ALGEBRAIC_LOCK.md): **Projection Proof**. Formalizes the 3/4 ratio as a requirement for 4D-to-3D state projection.

## 🛰️ Testable Predictions (The 2026 Benchmark)
- [NOVEL_PREDICTIONS.md](/NOVEL_PREDICTIONS.md): **The Euclid DR1 Falsification Track**. Defines the 0.781 matter attractor target for the October 21, 2026 data release.

## 📄 Theoretical Framework & Geometry
- [GEOMETRY_OF_THE_WAVE.md](/GEOMETRY_OF_THE_WAVE.md): **The "Hover" Effect**. Explains the 0.03 gap between the 0.75 Floor and the 0.78 Matter Attractor.
- [PROVING_THE_FLOOR.md](/PROVING_THE_FLOOR.md): Statistical alignment with current S8 tension datasets.

## 💻 Source Code
- [TOROIDAL_S8_ATTRACTOR.py](/code/TOROIDAL_S8_ATTRACTOR.py): **2026 Prediction Script**. Simulates the emergent **0.781 matter attractor** corridor.
- [bare_urfe.py](/code/bare_urfe.py): **Core Engine**. The base implementation of the 0.75 geometric limit verified in the audit.
